## Inspiration

This is a project created by Buildspace called "Build a Web3 App with Solidity", which I decided to take on and create.

## Challenges Faced

Understanding the intricacies of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Lessons Learned

I understood the fundamentals of the Ethereum blockchain. I also learned about writing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts created through Solidity.

## The Website

This website is a decentralized application (dApp) built using Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain, designed to showcase the fundamentals of Web3 development by enabling users to interact with smart contracts through a user-friendly interface.
